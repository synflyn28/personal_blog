Hello World! This post is the first for my data science blog, and I thought that I would never be able to create my own self-hosted blog in a relatively simple way. I would like to thank the R community for providing such an opportunity with [R Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and it further proves that the R community is one of the most welcoming in data science and shows what true collaboration is supposed to be.

Following that idea community is one of the reasons that I have chosen [data science](https://datajobs.com/what-is-data-science) following my career in meteorology and atmospheric science. Since meteorology is such a small field not many people understand its upsides and downsides but here I would like to elaborate simply a little on the challenges & changes in my career and why a transition from meteorology into the data science industry made sense from both a professional and creative perspective.

Not many people understand that despite being a hard science degree that requires many years of advanced mathematics and research, the science of meteorology has career issues that are in many ways unique to other scientific professions. There are of course the regular issues of [funding](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/02/589845319/national-weather-service-forecast-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-budget-cuts) and the [reproducibility crisis](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/how-culture-clash-noaa-led-flap-over-high-profile-warming-pause-study), but in meteorology there are also unique problems in both professional opportunities and pay. In fact the entry level job for the National Weather Service on average only pays $33,000 a year and if you want to be promoted to a better position you many times have to move to another office on the other side of the country. Broadcast and research don't provide much better opportunities either, with the former having starting salaries around 19K in small markets. You can read the full story about all of the issues surrounding meteorology [here](https://medium.com/@tmarquiswx/an-honest-conversation-about-early-career-professions-in-meteorology-704f8071d605).

What I wanted to do in meteorology was that I wanted to be a PhD meteorologist out in Oklahoma researching severe weather. I've wanted to be a meteorologist since I was 5 years old and I got my basic and advanced [SKYWARN](https://www.weather.gov/skywarn/) severe weather spotter certifications from the National Weather Service when I was 10. However after I got my degree in atmospheric science I was rejected from both of my graduate school choices and I decided to go on ahead an start working in industry. But instead
